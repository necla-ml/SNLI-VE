**SNLI-VE** is the dataset proposed for the **Visual Entailment (VE)** task investigated in [Visual Entailment Task for Visually-Grounded Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10582) accpeted to [NeurIPS 2018 ViGIL workshop](https://nips2018vigil.github.io/)).
Refer to our [full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06706) for detailed analysis and evaluations.

## Updates

12/10/2021:

- The Flickr images download is updated and now hosted by AlleNLP
- The Flickr features download link is updated but the archive may require newer unzip to decompress on Linux

NOTE: 

- The data remains hosted by external parties and subject to change

**NOTE**

`e-SNLI-VE-2.0` relabels the `dev` as well as `test` splits of the neutral class and evalutes the resulting performance in order of the original, val-correction and val/test correction configurations.

## Overview  

SNLI-VE is built on top of [SNLI](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli) and [Flickr30K](http://shannon.cs.illinois.edu/DenotationGraph).
The problem that VE is trying to solve is to reason about the relationship between an `image premise` **_P<sub>image</sub>_** and a `text hypothesis` **_H<sub>text</sub>_**.

Specifically, given an image as `premise`, and a natural language sentence as `hypothesis`, three labels (`entailment`, `neutral` and `contradiction`) are assigned based on the relationship conveyed by the (**_P<sub>image</sub>_**, **_H<sub>text</sub>_**)

- `entailment` holds if there is enough evidence in **_P<sub>image</sub>_** to conclude that **_H<sub>text</sub>_** is true.
- `contradiction` holds if there is enough evidence in **_P<sub>image</sub>_** to conclude that **_H<sub>text</sub>_** is false.
- Otherwise, the relationship is `neutral`, implying the evidence in **_P<sub>image</sub>_** is insufficient to draw a conclusion about **_H<sub>text</sub>_**.

## SNLI-VE Statistics  

Below is some highlighted dataset statistic, details can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10582).
  
### Distribution by Split

The data details of `train`, `dev` and `test` split is shown below. The instances of three labels (`entailment`, `neutral` and `contradiction`) are evenly distributed for each split.

|                      | **Train** | **Dev** | **Test** |

|  **Vocabulary Size** |  29550    | 6576    | 6592     |

### Question Length Distribution

The *question* here for SNLI-VE dataset is the `hypothesis`.
As shown in the figure, the question length of SNLI-VE dataset is distributed with a quite long tail.

## Caveats

To check the quality of SNLI-VE dataset, we randomly sampled 217 pairs from all three splits (565286 pairs in total).
Among all sampled pairs, 20 (about 9.2%) examples are incorrectly labeled, among which the majority is in the `neutral` class. 
This is consistent to the analysis reported by [GTE](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1199) in its Table 2.

It is worth noting that the original SNLI dataset is not perfectly labeled, 
with 8.8% of the sampled data not assigned a `gold label`, 
implying the disagreement within human labelers. 
SNLI-VE is no exception but we believe it is a common scenario in other large scale datasets.
However, if the dataset quality is a major concern to you, 
we suggest dropping the `neutral` classs and only use `entailment` and `contradiction` examples.

## SNLI-VE Creation

[snli_ve_generator.py](vet/tools/snli_ve_generator.py) generates the SNLI-VE dataset in `train`, `dev` and `test` splits with disjoint image sets. 
Each entry contains a `Flickr30kID` field to associate with the original Flickr30K image id. 

[snli_ve_parser.py](vet/tools/snli_ve_parser.py) parses entires in SNLI-VE for applications and is free to revise.

Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and generate SNLI-VE:

1. Set the conda environment and dependencies

    ```sh
    conda create -n vet37 python=3.7
    conda activate vet37
    conda install jsonlines
    # conda install -c NECLA-ML ml
    ```

2. Clone the repo

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/necla-ml/SNLI-VE.git
    ```

2. Generate SNLI-VE in `data/`

    ```sh
    cd SNLI-VE
    python -m vet.tools.snli_ve_generator.py
    ```

3. Download dependent datasets: Flickr30K, Entities, SNLI, and RoI features 

    ```sh
    cd data
    ./download # y to all if necessary
    ```

<!--
4. Extract RoI features from pre-extracted

  ```sh
  python -m vet.tools.ROI_related
  ```

5. Train models

  ```sh
  ```

6. Evaluation

  ```sh
  ```
-->

### SNLI-VE Extensions  
  
[Flickr30k Entities](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~bplumme2/Flickr30kEntities) dataset is an extension to Flickr30k, which contains grounded RoI and entity annotations. 

It is easy to extend our SNLI-VE dataset with **[Flickr30k Entities](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~bplumme2/Flickr30kEntities/)** if fine-grained annotations are required in your experiments.
